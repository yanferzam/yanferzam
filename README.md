- 👋 Hi, I’m @yanferzam
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, quantitative methods in social sciences, sociology, and pursing graduate studies in data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dplyr, RStudio, and how to clean data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing, currently busy with my own research. Perhaps in the near future. :)
- 📫 How to reach me ... if you know me, you know where to find me ;)
